Adds a bit of extra functionality and info to the Group & Activity Finder UI

[B]IMPORTANT:[/B] This addon use ZOS Dungeon Mode to decide which activities to choose. This means that if you have normal selected only normal activities will be selected. On the other hand if you have veteran selected only veteran activities will be selected. To change the Dungeon Mode go open the Group & Activity Finder, select the Group tab and on the top of the window you will see the Dungeon Mode selection UI

Currently it does not support controller.
